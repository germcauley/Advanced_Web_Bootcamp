                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>

                <p>
                    avaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.
                    You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
                    You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
                    or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                    Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <p>
                    To get started with writing JavaScript,
                    open the Scratchpad and write your first
                    "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>

                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                </p>
                <p></p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section">
                <h1>Global variables</h1>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window,
                    so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
                <p></p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section">
                <h1>Constants</h1>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                    The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:
                    it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or
                    underscore characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                            const PI = 3.14;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running.
                    It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables.
                    If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                            // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                            CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                            }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                            const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                    </code>

                </p>

                <p>
                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true.
                    Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.
                    An if statement looks as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                    if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
                    See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.
                    If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                    statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                    including further nested if statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence,
                    as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
