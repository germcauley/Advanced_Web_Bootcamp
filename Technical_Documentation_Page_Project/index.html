          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:

            This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="main-li">
              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
              (WWW).
            </li>
            <li class="main-li">Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li class="main-li">
              Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
              one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

          <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
          <p>
            avaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. 
                You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. 
                You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, 
                or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. 
                Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, 
                open the Scratchpad and write your first 
                "Hello world" JavaScript code: 
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>
